# JavaScript Calculator
A small calculator app I made in an afternoon.

This is the first thing I made on my own after learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Nothing special, but I thought it was cool at the time =)

### How to use:
- Download Zip
- Open index.html
- Enjoy

### Known bugs:
- Clearing the equation while an operator is selected will fail to clear the selected operator upon further use
- There is no limit to how long an equation can be (this causes obvious visual problems)
- Deleting all of the digits of a number leaves an empty space rather than a 0
- When left with an empty space via the bug above ^ you are able to type an unlimited amount of left-trailing zeroes
- A weird bug can be found when deleting a decimal

### Unknown bugs:
- Many
